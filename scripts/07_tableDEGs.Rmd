```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

Import file with information about differentially expressed genes.

```{r}
dissociation <- read.csv("../results/01_dissociation_volcanoTreatment.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
head(dissociation)
str(dissociation)
```

Filter out non-significant genes, sort by p-value, rename column, round to 2 decimal places. 

```{r}
DEGes <- dissociation %>%
  filter(color != "none") %>%
  arrange((padj))
DEGes$pvalue <- NULL # drop log pvalue columns
names(DEGes)[4] <- "upregulated in"
DEGes$lfc <- signif(DEGes$lfc, digits = 2)
DEGes$padj <- signif(DEGes$padj, digits = 3)
```


```{r}
write.csv(DEGes, file = "../results/SuppTable1.csv", row.names = F)
```

List of 117 taken from Sanes and Lichtman 1999
