# Figures 

This directory contains all figures that I've made recently. Most .png files are created for viewing within the .md files generated by the .Rmd file. Most .pdf files are used for publication. Then, I assemble them together in multipanel figures using Adobe Illustrator. 

The following descriptions are not ready for publication, rather they are converational descriptions of the current state.

**Figure 1.** General expression patterns show no major pattern of gene expression alteration. 1A. Experimental design. 1B. Volcano plot showing an exploratory(?) analysis of regional differences, for comparison to published literature. 1C. Volcano plot showing a weak but asymmetric response of gene expression to dissociation. 1D. PCA showing that no major pattern of an effect of dissociation, but also showing that regions are as clearly separated as one would expect given the literature. 

| Two-way contrast | Down-regulated | Up-regulated | % DEGs |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| DG vs. CA1 | 262 | 222 | 2.9% |
| DG vs. CA3 | 53 | 45 | 0.5% |
| CA3 vs. CA1 | 1 | 17 | 0.1% | 
| control vs. dissociated | 288 | 56 | 2.1% |

**Table 1.** Number of differentially expressed genes by 2-way contrast. "Down-regulated" means that expression is higher in the term on the far left of column 1. "Up-regulated" means that expression is higher in the term on the right of column 1. This shows that there is more variation due to subfield than treatment.

**Figure 2.** The gene list and go terms that everyone wants to know. 2A The top 30 most differentially expressed genes. Genes are clustered by correlation but samples are NOT clustered! Only "Jun" jumps out as a gene related to learning and memory. 2B List of molecular function categories that are enriched or depleted in the dissociated tissues relative to controls. Again, nothing jumps out as classic memory pathways, but there are some interesting affects on DNA regulation (methylation, chromatin, histone, RNA binding, helicase) and metabolism (oxidoreductase, cytokin, growth factors, ligase).
