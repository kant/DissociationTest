These first two plots show that with normalization (as done by DESeq)
that our samples can be on the same y axis scale.

This plot shows the clear separation between the cembrowski and the
harris data. Next, the regions and the the dorsal ventral patterning
seaparates in the cembrowski dataset. Next, DG in my data appeas
distinct but CA1 and CA3 are mixed. In the bottom heatmap, you can see
that including more genes helps separate CA1 and CA3 in my data.

I really love this PCA analysis. PC1 separates the two experiments. PC2
separates DG from the CAs.
