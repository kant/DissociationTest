Methods for Dorsal Hippocampal Gene Expression Profiling
--------------------------------------------------------

#### Part 3: Examining fac-sorted pyramindal neurons from CA1 and CA3 as well as granular cells from DG from Cembrowski et al 2016.

This ([2016 Cembrowski
paper](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e14997#fig1s30)) is very
similar to my experiment, so I want to compare the two. Like mine, they
compare hippocampal gene expression from dorsal CA1, CA3, and DG sub
regions. These cells were identifed through fac sorting to isolate
genetically labeled CA1 and CA3 pyramical neurons and DG granular cells.
